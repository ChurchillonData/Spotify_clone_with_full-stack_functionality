##  Project Overview

This project builds a full-stack Spotify Song Dataset Analyzer using a public dataset of top Spotify tracks (1998â€“2020). It involves cleaning and storing data in SQLite, performing analytical queries, and generating insightful visualisations with Matplotlib.

**Key Features:**
- Genre-based statistics for a specific year  
- Artist popularity comparisons across genres  
- Top 5 artist ranking within a custom timeframe  
- Visual analytics for trend discovery  

The dataset includes metadata like song title, artist, duration, popularity, danceability, energy, and genre
